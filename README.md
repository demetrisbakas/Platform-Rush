# Platform-Rush
> A simple infinite platformer game.

## How this came to be

This is a game I developed a while ago using Unity and C#. It was more of a learning project for me, so it might be a bit rough around the edges, but when I finished it, I made it available to both Windows and Android. Now, because of lack of support, it is removed from those platforms, so I decided to make the source code available. You can also find the build files here in **Releases**.
